# Snake Game🐍 using Turtle module of Python

🌟Built the classic Snake Game with help of OOP, Python Classes, Multiple Object instances, Class Inheritance and more.

👉Use the Turtle module to design the Snake class in snake.py file with methods to create, add, extend, reset and turn the snakes.

👉Built the Food class which inherits from the Turtle class in food.py file to generate food object instances in the game.

👉Use the Scoreboard class inherited from the Turtle class in scoreboard.py file with argument to track the user score and methods to update, reset and increase score.

👉The Data.txt file holds the record of high score of user and is read during initalization of scoreboard and updated after every reset game condition.

👉The main.py file controls the overall working of the game and it is here where the Game over conditions are tested and respective actions are taken.

👉The main.py file also designs the Screen object for the game. It controls the snake animations with modifying the tracer method and updating the screen regularly.
